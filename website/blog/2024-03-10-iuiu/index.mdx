### ‚ö°Ô∏è Welcome

We are very happy to introduce **[IUIU](https://kitiplex.github.io/iuiu/)** - a straightforward documentation website built by humans for humans. üéâ ü•≥Ô∏è

The term **IUIU** or pronouced as **_yuyu_** holds two distinct and contrasting definitions, signifying both positive and negative aspects. 

{/*truncate*/}

- ‚úÖ The letters 'I' and 'U' are easily accessible and;
- ‚úÖ In the local dialect, **IUIU** pronounced as _'yuyu'_ translates to 'uncle' suggesting the idea that **_"You cannot teach old dogs new tricks"_**. üòÑ

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Abstract

Our aim is to establish an intuitive **Knowledge Base Portal** with well-organized information, esuring universal accessibility and usefulness.

This project is innovatively by the **80/20 rule** or the **[Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp)** where:

- We can get 80% of the results for 20% of the effort;

- 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes, asserting an unequal relationship between inputs and outputs.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Tech aspects

**IUIU** is built with **[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/typescript-support)** `--typescript variant` based on several factors including the notion of **"Modern problems requires modern solution"**. Get to know more about **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**.
