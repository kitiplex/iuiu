### ⚡️ Prologue

Welcome to **IUIU** -- A straightforward documentation hub created by **Kitiplex's [Core team](https://kitiplex.github.io/community/team#core-team)**. Explore __[this article](/blog/introducing-iuiu)__ to discover the reasons behind choosing the name **IUIU** and other good stuff.


<!-- ### ⚡️ Motivation

In general, our goal is to create an **INTUITIVE** software for both end-users and developers. Learn more about the quality documention in [this article](https://mkeithx.github.io/blog/good-docs). -->



It stands as one of our highlighted projects as we work towards transforming it into a comprehensive **Knowledge Base Portal**. Everything here is a work-in-progress and we are open for discussions, feature requests and bug reports.

:::tip[]

We have established specific criteria for bug reports outlined in __[this article](./kbase/kangaroo/buganizer.mdx)__.

:::

<!-- Additionally, this website is one of our featured projects as we are utilizing the ``--typescript`` variant as we aim towards to becoming a full **Knowledge Base** portal. Everthing thing here is a work-in-progress and if you notice any malfuctions and other errors, you can file a [bug report](https://github.com/kitiplex/iuiu/issues/new/choose). 





Why so special? There are two factors: 

1. For Developers - The core language of this project is written in ``typescript``;

1. For End-users - Nothing has changed. It's still easy to maintain. -->
